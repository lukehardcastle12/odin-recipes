    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Salmon sushi is often eaten “nigiri” style, with a ball of vinegared sushi 
        rice topped with a slice of salmon. It's commonly enjoyed with wasabi and 
        soy sauce, or salt and a bit of citrus
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>¼ cup rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li>1 medium avocado, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) farmed Atlantic salmon</li>
        <li>3 stalks green onions, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>¼ cup sriracha mayonnaise (Kikkoman)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon wasabi paste, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pickled ginger, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rinse rice in a strainer under cold running water until water runs clear. 
            Combine rice and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, 
            reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, combine rice wine vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. 
            Cook over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Remove and allow to cool. 
            Stir vinegar mixture into the cooked rice - rice will dry as it cools. 
            Allow rice to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a sheet of nori onto a sushi mat. 
            Place about 1/2 cup rice on top and, using a rice paddle, 
            spread rice onto the nori sheet. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Flip nori over so rice is facing down. Arrange 3 to 4 avocado slices, 
            about 2 ounces salmon, 1 strip green onion, 
            and 2 teaspoons Sriracha mayonnaise down the middle of the nori sheet. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully, but tightly, roll nori up by closing in on the ingredients to 
            form a roll. Drizzle each roll with hoisin sauce and more Sriracha mayonnaise 
            and sprinkle with both types of sesame seeds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice each sushi roll into 8 pieces. Serve with a dollop of wasabi and 
            pickled ginger on the side.
        </li>
    </ol>
